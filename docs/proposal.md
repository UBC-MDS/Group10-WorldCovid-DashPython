# Covid-19 World Data Dashboard

## Motivation and purpose

## Description of the data

We will utilise the dataset which contains the important statistics around the world from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). Till now, the dataset contains over 150,000 entries from Jan 2020 that covers four key areas per country on daily basis:

- Number of cases: `total_cases`, `new_cases`
- Number of deaths: `total_deaths`, `new_deths`
- Number of hospitalizations: `hosp_patients`, `icu_patients`
- Number of people vaccinated: `people_vaccinated`, `people_fully_vaccinated`

By default, our app will show the above statistics of Canada against other countries into several interactive dashboards. Besides, it will have user-friendly functions to filter the entries by other demographics  (`country`, `continent`) and date which the user are interested in.

`Table 1` illustrates some sample records with some features we will be visualizing as charts.

|Country|Date|Total cases|Total deaths|Hospitalization patients|Fully vaccinated|
|-------|----|-----------|------------|------------------|----------------|
|Canada|2022-02-01|3066278|34032|1167|30182561|
|Japan|2022-02-01|2820053|18882|22653|99824114|
|United Kingdom|2022-01|17470395|157005|502|48467140|
