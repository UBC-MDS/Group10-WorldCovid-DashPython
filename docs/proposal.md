# Covid-19 World Data Dashboard 

## Motivation and purpose

Our role: Data scientist consultancy firm.

Target audience: Canadian public health communicators, such as the chief public health officer for Canada, Health Canada employees etc.

The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the lives of all Canadians. Almost overnight, Canadian's shifted their behaviours and actions in response to government direction advised by Canada's public health officials. Towards the beginning of the pandemic, Canada was seen as a global leader COVID-19 outcomes, which was largely attributed to policies such as strict travel measures, testing procedures, and large scale vaccination roll-out and uptake. More recently however, Canada has been in the news for large scale protests criticizing the government response, drawing comparisons with other nations. 

If we could compare Canada to it's global counterparts using daily COVID-19 statistics, we could obtain a better understanding of Canada's relative successes in it's handling of the pandemic. To address this challenge, our group proposes building a data visualization app that would allow Canadian public health communicators to assess or justify policy decisions by visually exploring Canada's COVID-19 indicators relative to other nations.
 
Our app will show  and allow users to explore different aspects of this data by filtering for country, continent, and time frame. Our app will also allow users to decide which scale they would like to view the data on. We feel that these tools will be an effective way to to compare COVID-19 indicators between nations.
