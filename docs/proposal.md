# Covid-19 World Data Dashboard 

## Motivation and purpose


## Description of the data


## Research questions and usage scenarios

Mary is a doctor with the Canadian Ministry of Health and she wants to understand the current state of the COVID19 pandemic globally, in order to communicate these results with other government officials.

Specifically, she wants to be able to explore key covid metrics and trends in order to compare how different counties have approached the pandemic relative to Canada. This will provide context for Canada's situation, the insights from which can go towards informing policies and recommendations within the Ministry of Health, as well as communication with the public.

When Mary logs on to the “World Covid Metrics app”, she will see an overview of all the available variables in her data set, according to the current global data available provided by University of Oxford. Specifically, Canada's data will be displayed prominently first, with options to add other countries to compare in the visualizations. Covid cases will be displayed on a map by default, with options to display deaths, vaccines, hospitalizations, ICU admissions etc. She can filter out variables by time using a slider, in order to view data for specific time periods by month. When she does so, Mary may notice that at the beginning of the pandemic, Canada faced lower rates of ICU admissions than the United States. She may also see that North American and European Countries were the first to receive vaccines, and may use this to communicate to the Ministry which other countries are in need of vaccine supply. 

She hypothesizes that lower income countries have higher case counts and lower vaccines, and decides to conduct additional research into the identified countries that have higher rates of covid.

Mary may also see that countries with higher vaccine rates see lower covid cases per captia, but only for a limited period of time. She hypothesizes that their are thresholds of time for vaccines having a significant effect on hospitalization and ICU admissions, and decides to use additional data and analysis to gain statistical evidence on how long vaccines can be expected to influence hospitalization rates. The results from which may inform public health timelines for covid measures, as well as recommendations of additional vaccines doses.
