# Reflection

## Progress of the dashboard:

Out team has implemented the <a href=https://worldcovid-dashpy-stg.herokuapp.com>World COVID Dashboard</a> following most of our initial design and proposal. Most of our dashboard's functionality is implemented and we also made a number of improvements to resolve any potential confusion in our original sketch design. Our dashboard is still centred by a world map showing COVID indicators across the world; however, we have rejigged the layout to have 3 global filters controlling two different tabs - Map and Plot, in order to fix the confusion of which filter to control the map or the line plots. The global 3 filters are linear/log radio button for the data presentation, country selector for multiple country selections, and data range slider. We also have upgraded our country selector to be easily selected instead of rolling a long list of various countries. More specifically, we created two different tabs for a more organized data visualization - the first tab includes a map and a complement line chart for one variable filter that effects those charts; the second tab includes two static charts for the vaccination data. Our team is pleased to illustrate the map that users can interactively view summarized data when moving the cursor on the map for the pointed country. There are some interactions based on filtered data for the map and the line chart. We also presented a stacked bar chart for the vaccination numbers.

## Areas of Improvement/Enhancement (Liminations) for the dashboard:

There are still a few areas that our teams thrive to cover in the next milestone/implementation.

- Potentially improve the country map animation such as removing repetitive date labels on the slider and opting for the singular date
- Allow filtering by time frame for charts showing the trend
- Improve the user experience of the dashboard, and use more meaningful color to represent the data in the visualization.
- Add a time stamp for the last updated data, and so the user can have a general sense of when our data is updated on the dashboard
