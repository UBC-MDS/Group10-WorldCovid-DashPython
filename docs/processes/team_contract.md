# DSCI 532 Project Team Contract
Group 10 - February 15, 2022


## TEAM PROJECT TOPIC
Our project, worldcovid-dash, is to design a dashboard for interactive data visualization, exploration and communication. In this contract, we will state the rules that should be followed by all the team members. The teamwork contract aims to let everyone in the team feel supported and succeed at the end of this project. Team members are expected to follow this contract.

## WORK DISTRIBUTION
At the beginning of each new milestone we will all agree together on a fair, transparent, & equitable distribution of work. Our strategy for splitting the work will be to assign tasks worth an equal amount of points (as outlined in the rubric for each milestone) to each team member. 

## MEETINGS
At the beginning of each week we will have a meeting in the Tuesday lab (or slack/zoom) to distribute work for the next milestone and briefly discuss our overall plan & strategy for the week during or after our lab. Meeting minutes should be taken for each of our meetings, as this is when we will distribute work for the week. Meeting minutes should be posted in our group slack channel right after the meeting so everyone has a reference of their responsibilities.
Each Friday afternoon-2pm or as discussed and scheduled in the Slack we will have a call (via slack or zoom) to go over work for the week and decide whether any changes need to be made before submission.

## COMMUNICATION
All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack or Github. Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication, ideas, and scheduling meetings. Repository issues should be reviewed and acknowledged within half a business day after creation. Slack response turnaround should be within 3 hours if possible.

## REVIEWS 
The goal of our optional Friday calls will be to review everyone’s work, and make any last suggestions/updates that need to happen before submitting our work for the week. We all agree to have our individual work done (pull request made & ready for review) before these calls. We are targeting to submit each project by end of day Friday each week, by approximately 8pm, and will not leave the submission until the last minute on Saturday.

## AVAILABILITY
Within reason, we are all available to work & meet outside of lecture/lab time. Late evenings are a last resort for meeting times, and Sunday’s we will not be working. We are going to treat March 18th as the final project due date.

## BREACH OF CONTRACT
We’ve decided to have no formal “breach of contract” rules. Any time someone feels that they won’t be able to submit their work by Friday, they should notify the group by Friday at 10am at the latest. We can then decide as a team what to do. We will either re-distribute the work or push our review meeting later in the day (or to Saturday as a last resort).
