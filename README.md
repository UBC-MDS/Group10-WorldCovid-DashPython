# World COVID-19 Dashboard (Python)

## Welcome :microbe: :earth_asia:

Thank you for visitng the World COVID-19 Dashboard app project repository.

## What are we doing and why are we doing it?


# The Problem

- The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the lives of all people.
- Access to open source data that delivers information on the current states of the pandemic through data alone is key to informing both policy makers and regular citizens alike with the least bias possible, however few sources are engaging and intuitive.

Many COVID related policies such as strict travel measures, testing procedures, and large scale vaccination roll-out and uptake have varied between nations and have caused controversy. Their impact is difficult to assess without easily interpretable and accurately presented data.

# The Solution
To address this challenge, we have built the World COVID-19 Dashboard app that:
- vizualises key data indicators about COVID 19 such as deaths, hospitalizations and vaccination numbers, allowing users to explore and quickly understand the current state of the pandemic situation globally
- allows for comparison across nations, and adjustable timelines to suit the curiosity of the user
- vizualizes data over time and across different countries in an engaging and tangible way with customizations and animations

# Who are we?

We are group 10 from DSCI 532. Please read the contributors section for more information on our team.

# The design
Our app consists of three main tabs: Global COVID-19 Indicators and Vaccination and Hospitalization Indicators.

Global COVID-19 Indicators:
 - This tab aims to give a "global overview" of the COVID-19 situation. The tab has two main elements, an animated global map that highlights selected countries for the selected indicator and a line plot that depicts the same data in a different format. Both of these visualization elements are filtered using the "Indicator" drop down to select which indicator is visualized, the "Country" filter to select which countries are showcased, and the "Date range" slider at the top of the screen that limits or expands the visiualized timeline. A main focus of this tab is the animation in the map, which shows the change in data over time by country. This element is expecially important as it tells a story of where the world started, where it went, and how far it has come in a very tangible way. The line plot is also filterable by data type: linear or log

Vaccination and Hospitalization:
- This tab aims to give a sense of the movement of vaccinaction rates and hospitalizations, and how that differed between nations throughout the pandemic. It consists of four line charts; total vaccinations by country, new vaccinations by country, current ICU hospitalizations, and current hospitalizations. Simialr to the first tab, the charts are filtered by the "Country" filter to select which countries are showcased, and the "Date range" slider at the top of the screen that limits or expands the visiualized timeline. They can also be filtered by data type: linear or log.

# Usage
- Per the GIF below, our app is meant to be highly filterable and interactive and can be used multiple ways to suit the data needs of policy makers, and public health communicators in the best way they see fit for the message they want to convey
